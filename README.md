# CreditCrawaler APP | Scraping Bank Fees & Interest Rates
---

#The CreditCrawler app was created to help users search for the lowest interest rate and bank fee among three different banks when applying for a $1,000 credit. The app works by scraping data from each bank's website and comparing the interest rates and bank fees for a $1,000 credit. The app then presents the user with the bank that has the lowest interest rate and bank fee, helping them to save money on their credit. This app is easy to use and can be a helpful tool for anyone who is looking to get the best deal on their credit.
